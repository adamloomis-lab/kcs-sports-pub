      <h2>Our commitment</h2>
      <p>
        This site is built to WCAG 2.1 AA, the standard referenced by the ADA for web
        accessibility. We review and update our accessibility practices on an ongoing basis.
      </p>

      <h2>What we have done</h2>
      <p>
        We have taken the following steps to make this site accessible to as many people as
        possible:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Skip links allow keyboard and screen reader users to bypass navigation and get straight
          to the main content.
        </li>
        <li>
          A visible outline appears on every interactive element when navigated by keyboard, so
          focus is always clear.
        </li>
        <li>
          Text colors meet the 4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio for readability by people with low
          vision.
        </li>
        <li>
          All form fields, buttons, and interactive elements have descriptive labels for screen
          readers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Animations automatically reduce for users who have the Reduce Motion preference enabled
          on their device.
        </li>
      </ul>
